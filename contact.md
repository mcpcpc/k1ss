CONTACT
=======

Hi there! Dylan Araps has been out of contact since the end of November 2020,
however since then, the GitHub organization kiss-community has taken charge of
maintaining packages, and keeping the distro up to date. If you'd like to get
involved, join us at #kisslinux on Freenode, or github.com/kiss-community!
