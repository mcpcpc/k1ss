KISS LINUX
==========

An independent Linux(R) distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept
of less is more.

Static Packaging System
-----------------------

The package format is entirely static. A series of plain-text files with fields
separated by lines and spaces. Easily parseable via any programming language or
with basic UNIX utilities.

Portable Package Manager
------------------------

The package manager is written in less than 1000 lines of POSIX shell with a
large emphasis on portability. The only requirements are a POSIX compliant
environment, curl and git.

Bus Factor of Zero
------------------

The distribution is designed to be maintainable by a single person. There is no
infrastructure and the entire distribution is merely a few Git repositories. The
distribution's upstream is entirely optional.

Less Software
-------------

There is no lock-in to specific software. The user has the ability to mix and
match any shell, core utilities, init system, device manager and more. The
alternatives system enables this down to file level.
